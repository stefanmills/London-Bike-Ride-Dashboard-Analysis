# London Bike Ride Data Analysis and Visualization
![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

## Project Overview

This project revolves around the exploration, analysis, and visualization of the renowned London bike ride dataset. The process involves leveraging Python libraries such as Kaggle, Pandas, and Zipfile for data handling, exploration, and preparation. Furthermore, the Tableau platform is employed to craft impactful visualizations, incorporating elements like heatmaps, text annotations, line charts, reference bands, bins, and more.


## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Installing Required Python Libraries

Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install kaggle pandas zipfile
```

### 2. Downloading the Dataset Using Kaggle API

1. Obtain a Kaggle account and API key.
2. Place your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) in the project root directory.
3. Execute the following command to download the dataset:

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d <kaggle_dataset_name> -p data/
```

### 3. Data Exploration and Cleaning with Pandas

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to engage with Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts tailored for dataset exploration and cleaning.

### 4. Visualization on Tableau

Delve into the Tableau visualizations. The Tableau workbook file (.twb) encapsulates various visualizations comprising heatmaps, text annotations, line charts, reference bands, bins, and more.

## Viewing the Project
